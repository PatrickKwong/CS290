Hello EC2 and Git

Due Sunday by 11:59pm  Points 10 Submitting a text entry box

This weeks assignment is to get set up with Amazon EC2 and GitHub. It is primarily a technical hurdle that needs to be overcome. If all goes smoothly this should be a 20 minute process, but be prepared for things to not go smoothly. Make sure to get started early on this as it can take awhile to troubleshoot problems.

Requirements:

- Clone and start the Amazon EC2 virtual machine for this class
- Start the Node.js process
- Create a GitHub account (and I would highly recommend requesting a student dev pack as well from https://education.github.com/ (Links to an external site.), you get a premium account for free and some other neat software)
- Create a GitHub repository and add some content to it

Deliverables:
- The address where we can access your EC2 machine. (This will be an IP address in the form of xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:3000)
- A link to your GitHub repository where you have added OSU-CS290-Tester as a collaborator
- This repository should have at least 2 files added to it.
